**“How do I get started?”**

Most of the original **Speaking in Code** participants found that we have
encountered this question in some form, either on a mailing list or in
person, from someone new to the digital humanities who wanted to get
started developing DH projects. It's not an easy question to
answer, but it's one we encounter so often, we felt like exploring it
together.

So here we share, informally and briefly, advice and the
experiences some of us have had getting started in the work we do. We also muse on the things that  influence how we answer
questions like these. Often, our personal histories with tacit
knowledge acquisition lead us to address attitudes and philosophies for dealing with our work, rather than offer
a *right* or *best* answer.

Contributors framed the kind of question they
wanted to answer, and how they wanted to answer it. Some variations on
the question you may encounter in this stories include:

- Where did I start?
- How did I get started?
- How did I get restarted?
- How do I not quit?
- Why did I quit?
- Why did I start?
- Did I start?

We hope these stories help you [get started](http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/#outcomes).
