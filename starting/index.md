“How do I get started?”

During *Speaking in Code*, participants found that most of us had
encountered that question in some form, either on a mailing list or in
person, from someone new to the Digital Humanities who wanted to get
started doing devleopment on DH projects. It's not an easy question to
answer, but it's one that we encounter enough that we felt exploring it
together.

So here we share, in an informal and shortish (500 words) space, the
experiences each of us have had getting started doing the kind of work
each of us does, and all the things that would influence how we’d answer
that question posted to us by folks genuinely interested in doing the
kind of work we do. We share our personal histories acquiring tacit
knowledge, and find that the answers end up being more about emphasizing
personal attitudes and philosophies for dealing with our work than
finding a *right* or *best* answer.

We gave particpants the freedom to frame the kind of question they
wanted to answer, and how they wanted to answer it. Some variations on
the question you may encounter in this stories include:

- Where did I start?
- How did I get started?
- How did I get restarted?
- How do I not quit?
- Why did I quit?
- Why did I start?
- Did I start?

We hope these stories help you to get started.
