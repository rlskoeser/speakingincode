# Eric Rochester

I started where I was, with what I had.

Whenever we visited my cousins', I spent the time on their [Vic 20][vic20].

I taught myself [binary][binary] numbers, because I didn't have consistent
access to a computer and that was as close as I could get. After all, isn't
binary what computers speak?

At school, I stole time on a [TRS-80][trs80] in another classroom.

I learned [BASIC][basic] from a book, away from a computer.

I finally wore my parents down enough that they bought me a [Commodore
64][com64].

For a while, I didn't have a good way to save anything, so I programmed the
same stupid game over and over. Your spaceship explores a randomly generated
10x10 grid and has to destroy enemies and pick up asteroids. It was more fun to
create the game than it was to play it.

Looking back, three things strike me about this path into computers and
programming:

First, in the details of what I was doing, in the difficulty of everything, the
sheer frustration involved and the lack of any immediate feedback, this was a
*horrible* way to start.

Second, having to work like this isn't a bad thing. I valued the time I did get
on a computer more. And I did it because I wanted it deeply, as only a
twelve-year-old can.

Plus there's a lot in computers that just is work. A lot can best be described
as bland frustration topped with frustration with a tart side of annoyance.
Having to work to get started made all the pain involved since then seem almost
normal.

And third, because I was twelve, everything I did was play. I built games for
myself. I poked and prodded the machines to see what they could do. I followed
my curiosity. I had no agenda except amusing myself.

That was good the good part.

So how do you start?

First, find something you're passionate about. How do making, computers, or
programming apply to that? It's become increasingly easy to make this
connection, especially with the rise of [3D printing][printing] and easily
hackable embedded systems like [Arduino][arduino].

The real issue isn't passion, though. It's work. What will motivate you to put
in the work? What will make the time invested seem shorter than it really is?

Second, work. There's really no substitute. If you want to learn to program,
you need to spend a lot of time typing. The [Learn Code the Hard Way][hardway]
series has this exactly right: most programming is just muscle memory, and you
learn it by doing it. And doing it again. And again.

This applies to other types of making as well. There are certain core tasks
that you'll spend most of the time doing, even though they aren't really
interesting themselves. But if you want to create beautiful paintings, you have
to learn to work with paint.

Finally, play. Follow not just your passion, but also your curiosity. If you
wonder what will happen if you turn the background of a web page brown and make
the text transparent, don't ask. Just try it and see.

So.

Work. Work. And play.
