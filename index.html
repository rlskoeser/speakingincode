    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><strong>Speaking in Code</strong> is an <a href="http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh">NEH-funded</a> symposium and summit that will bring together approximately 20 accomplished digital humanities software developers at the University of Virginia Library <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a>. Together, we will give voice to what is almost always tacitly expressed in our work: expert knowledge about the intellectual and interpretive dimensions of DH code-craft, and unspoken understandings about the relation of that work to ethics, scholarly method, and humanities theory.</p>
	<p>Over the course of two days in November 2013, participants will:
		<ul>
			<li>reflect on and express, from developers’ own points of view, what is particular to the humanities and of scholarly significance in DH software development products and practices;</li>
			<li>and collaboratively devise an action-oriented agenda to bridge the gaps in critical vocabulary and discourse norms that can frequently distance creators of humanities platforms or tools from the scholars who use and critique them.</li>
		</ul></p>
    <p>This will be the first focused meeting to address the implications of tacit knowledge exchange in the digital humanities. Watch this space and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/scholarslab">@ScholarsLab</a> for outcomes from <strong>Speaking in Code</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Agenda</h1>
    <p>We start from the premise that humanities software development holds more in common with traditional arts-and-crafts practice than with academic discourse, and that its methods and assumptions may embed a valuable, largely non-verbal new hermeneutic of “making.” The <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> program calls on five respected, versatile, and motivated experts in the field to help participants articulate—from their own vantage points—whether and to what degree tacit humanities knowledge is embedded in DH developers’ craft, and to outline the new scholarly and methodological understandings that may be emergent from their praxis.</p>
	<p>The second part of the summit will be a unconference-style “Development Day,” designed to foster grassroots leadership among participants and seed collaborative projects that may be technical or social in nature. Projects pitched on the second day are meant to address the larger goals of <strong>Speaking in Code</strong> and the most practicable and potentially transformative among them may be undertaken by the <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars’ Lab</a> and new partners after the summit ends.</p>

						<p><strong>Activity</strong>: Brainstorming a working list of areas in which tacit understanding and hands-on journeyman learning experiences make it difficult for scholars and junior developers to engage with the theoretical side of DH code craft.

This presentation will address the division that can occur between design and development, even in humanities projects in which design elements take on particular rhetorical or interpretive significance.</p>

					<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Share your own stories. How have you worked to incorporate ambiguity or contradictory evidence in humanities computing projects? When have you decided to elide it, why, and with what impact on the scholarly arguments your tool enabled?

Our local airport is <a href="http://www.gocho.com/">CHO</a>, a short taxi ride to the north of town. Charlottesville is approximately 110 miles and two hours south of Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab">Scholars’ Lab</a> is located in Alderman Library, behind the café on the main floor (4 West).  View the Scholars’ Lab and Alderman Library (and relationship to parking) <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214746544792154569224.0004bad534c15770e9ddd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=38.038154,-78.502883&amp;spn=0.005797,0.013937">on a Google map</a>.</p>

    <h1>You Are Welcome Here</h1>
    <p>This is a small planning and problem-scoping meeting, meant to provide an
    opportunity for advanced software developers to address shared issues in DH
    and tacit knowledge&mdash;on their own terms. Because software development&mdash;even in the more intellectually
  diverse and welcoming digital humanities&mdash;is a predominantly white and
  male profession, we are particularly committed to amplifying the voices of
  developers who are women, people of color, queer/LGBT, or otherwise
  under-represented among programmers, and to creating a friendly and respectful
  environment for collaboration at this event. Whether you're an attendee or a member of the interested public, if you have questions, special
